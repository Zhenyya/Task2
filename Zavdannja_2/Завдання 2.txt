Create class Fruit (field name) which implements two interfaces: IJuiceable (method makeJuice()) and ISliceable (method makeSlices()). When we call these methods for Fruit - it should return string "Juice from Name_Of_Fruit" (or "Slice from Name_Of_Fruit"). 
Class Fresh consists of two containers: Juices and Slices. By calling method addToJuices() (or addToSlices()) we may add new Fruit to these containers. By calling method makeFresh() we may produce all Freshes (Juices and Slices).

Which hierarchy of classes is the best for solving this problem?
Write short code to demonstrate your solution.
Your code should include class (interface) aggregation or inheritance, should use collections or generics, should implement exception handling.
